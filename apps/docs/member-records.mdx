Once your community is connected, Conquest gathers data to generate member profiles, retrieving all activities from the past 365 days.

## Member table

The default members view ranks all your members according to their Member Level and displays a comprehensive information table that serves as both a reference and leaderboard. Find out more about [Member Level](/conquest-pulse/member-level).

### Company
Companies are created **based on email domains**, and members are linked to their respective companies.

### Tags
Depending on the community platform you connected, Conquest sync community tag and attributes them to each member. Learn how to manage community tags.

### Job Title
We retrieve the information that your members have added to their profile on your community.

### Langage, Country
Data provided by the platforms. It may be biased depending on the member’s language setting.

### Fist Activity
When an integration is first synced, we retrieve each member's first activity within the past 365 days. If their actual first activity occurred before this period, this date may not reflect their true first interaction. For new members joining after integration, we will capture their precise first activity date.

### Last Activity
A member most recent activity with your community across any connected platform. This timestamp updates in real-time as new activities occur, providing you with accurate recency information for engagement analysis and reactivation campaigns.

### Source
Indicates where a member first engaged with your community. If their first activity occurred on Slack, Slack will be listed as their source.

If profiles are later merged and we discover an earlier activity on another platform (such as LinkedIn), the source will update automatically to reflect this first true touchpoint.

The source attribute helps you understand which platforms are most effective at bringing new members into your community ecosystem.


## Member profile

By collecting all member activities and information, you gain access to a complete history of engagement when viewing any member's profile.

The member profile consists of 3 parts:

### Analytics tab

#### Heatmap

Member activity over the last 365 days, represented by colored squares. The intensity of the color indicates how active the member was on that day - the darker the color, the more activities they performed.

You can hover over each square to see the activity details.

<Tip> Rows represent days of the week, and columns represent weeks. </Tip>

The Heatmap view helps you:

- See when a member has been active throughout the year.
- Identify engagement patterns (e.g. more active on weekdays or weekends).
- Spot peaks and drops in activity, and link them to your communication efforts.
- Understand how their participation has evolved over time


### Level logs

The Level Logs is a chart that tracks and records the evolution of a member's engagement level every week over time. It retrieve all Member Level in the last 365 days.

It logs the exact date of each level change, the member's previous level, the new level reached, as well as the reason or actions that triggered this level change.

By analyzing these temporal trends, you can evaluate their future engagement potential and customize your communications to maximize their impact.

### Pulse logs

The Pulse Logs records and tracks how a member's engagement score (Pulse Score) changes over time. Find out more about the Pulse Score.

Like the Level Logs, it logs the exact date of each Pulse Score change, the member's previous score and their new score.

This allows you to see the evolution of the member's engagement and their consistency of engagement.

### Activity feed

A chronological feed of all member activities across platforms. Every future activity will be instantly shown in this tab.


### Member attributes

All member information are displayed on the member sidebar. You can add, edit or delete information directly from there. 

#### Enriched attributes

Attributes are enriched based on the platform you integrate to Conquest. New information found will update your member information. Conquest's ability to enrich each attribute is dependent on data availability.

#### Linked profiles

The member’s profile ID and a direct link to their profile on the connected platform are added.

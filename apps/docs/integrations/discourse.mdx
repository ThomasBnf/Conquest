## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why my community updates are not showing in Conquest?">
    If you are not seeing your community updates in Conquest, the most common cause is an incorrect webhook configuration. Please verify that:

    * You've added the correct secret key provided by Conquest
    * The webhook URL is exactly `https://app.useconquest.com/webhook/discourse`
    * Content type is set to "application/json"
    * All events are selected ("Send me everything")
    * Verify that the webhook is active

    Without proper webhook configuration, especially the secret key, we cannot authenticate and process real-time updates from your community.

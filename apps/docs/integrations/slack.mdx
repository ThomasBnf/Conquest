### Security Notice

<Note>
While our application isn't currently listed on Slack's official marketplace, we maintain enterprise-grade security standards. The security notice during installation is expected and doesn't affect the integration's functionality or safety.
</Note>

<Warning>
Slack's API restrictions limit data retrieval to the last 90 days for workspaces on the free plan. This limitation cannot be bypassed and applies to all third-party integrations.

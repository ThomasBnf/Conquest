## Create and export Lists

Lists transform how you manage and engage with your members by enabling precise, data-driven segmentation.

### Why do you need Lists?

Lists are a powerful tool to help you maximize the impact of your engagement.

They allow you to segment your community into specific groups, enabling you to tailor your messages based on interests, engagement level, or other relevant criteria increasing the effectiveness of your communications.

### Create Lists with Advanced Filters

Easily build custom member lists using filters from the Members table.

You can filter members based on a variety of criteria, such as:

- **Member attributes**: job title, company, location, source
- **Engagement level**: Ambassador, Contributor, Active, Explorer
- **Activity types**: posts, comments, reactions
- **Activity** frequency or recency
- **Tags** 

Combine multiple filters to narrow your segmentation. Use filters by count, channel, or date for better precision.

</Frame>

To create your list with the filtered view, click **Save.** Name your list and change the emoji to illustrate it.  

Click **Clear** to return to the default view.

Lists update automatically as members meet, or no longer meet, the criteria.
For example, if you create a list of “Active Members in Finance,” any new member who reaches the “Active” level and has “finance” in their job title will be added automatically.


<Tip>
    Lists are private and are not shared with other users in your workspace.

## Export List

Export your lists to integrate the information that Conquest provides in your other tools.

The export function delivers your member data in a structured CSV format containing all information about your members.

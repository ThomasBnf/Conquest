## Create and export Lists

Lists transform how you manage and engage with your community by enabling precise, data-driven segmentation.

### Why do you need Lists?

Lists are an essential tool for maximizing your community's value.

They allow you to segment your community into specific groups, enabling you to tailor your messages based on interests, engagement level, or other relevant criteria increasing the effectiveness of your communications.

For example, you could target only members active in the FinTech sector for a specialized event.

### Create Lists using Filters

You can create custom member lists using filters in the Members tab.

Add filters based on criteria such as:

- Member attributes (job title, company, location, source)
- Engagement level (Ambassador, Active, Contributor)
- Activity types (posts, comments, reactions)
- Tags you've assigned
- Activity frequency or recency

Add multiple filters to be very specific in your research. Filters by count, channel or date and adjust comparison operators to obtain precise results.

</Frame>

Save your filtered view as a list by clicking **Save.** Name your list and change the emoji to illustrate it.  

These lists update automatically as members meet or no longer meet your criteria. For example, if you create a list of "Active Members in Finance," any new members who match these criteria will automatically appear in your list.

Use **"Clear all filters"** to return to the default view.

<Tip>
    Lists are private and are not shared with other users in your workspace.

## Export List

Export your lists to integrate the information that Conquest provides in your favorite communication tool.

The export function delivers your member data in a structured CSV format containing all information about your members.

    Use export while waiting for our workflow feature.

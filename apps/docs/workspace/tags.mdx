Tags is a unique feature allowing you to organize your community in the most flexible way possible. 

Thanks to Conquest advanced filters, you can segment your community based on any combination of tags that are relevant to you. 

## Syncing tags from community platforms

Some community platforms like Discourse or Discord already have tags. For them, we are collecting all the tags when the community is connected and assign them to the dedicated member.

You can see and edit them your Tags page.

## Create Tags

You can create tags by clicking on **Settings**, **Tags** and **+ New Tag.** Add as many tags as you want, and assign a different color to each tag to easily differentiate them. 

Edit or delete tags by using the three dots on the right if they are no longer needed. You can also create/edit/delete tags directly from the members table or the member profile.

## Assign Tags

Once you have created your tags, you can assign them to members in three ways : 

- Multiple members: Go to Members Tab, select members with the select bar and click on **Add Tags**.
- Single member : Go to the member profile and click on **Add tags** on top of the member information.
- From the Members tab, click on the cell under Tags for each member and select the tags

Use the search bar to easily select tags.

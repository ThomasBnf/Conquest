## What is Merging?

Merging allows you to combine duplicate profiles of the same person into a single, comprehensive member record.

You should merge a member when the same person appears multiple times in your database due to different email addresses collected from platform integrations or if they have multiple accounts on the same platform.

By merging duplicates, you create a unified profile that consolidates all engagement history, activity metrics, and personal information.

## How it works?

When you find duplicate profiles, navigate to the profile you want to keep as primary. Click the three dots menu in the top right corner and select **Merge**.

A merge window will appear. Click the **+** button and use the search bar to find and select the duplicate profile you want to merge.

After selection, you'll see a preview of the merged profile with all consolidated information displayed on the right side.

**Merge rules**

- We use the right profile attributes as reference (e.g: name, email, job title, etc...)
- We use the date of the first activity as the reference for the source and creation date attributes.
- The following attributes will be combined: (e.g: tags, emails, phone numbers, activities)

<Warning>
    Merges cannot be undone once saved. Verify your selections before confirming the merge operation.

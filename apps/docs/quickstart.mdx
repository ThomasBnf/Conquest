## Create an account

Sign up for Conquest and follow the steps to create your account at [https://app.useconquest.com/auth/signup](https://app.useconquest.com/auth/signup).

If you need more information, feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@useconquest.com), we’d be happy to walk you through the product.

You can sign up with **Google** or simply with an **email address**.

During setup, you’ll be asked to add your workspace name and answer a few questions.


## Connect your community and other platforms

When you first sign up to Conquest, **we highly recommend syncing your community right away**. If you haven’t set it up yet, you can always do so later from your account **Settings** and click on **Integrations.**

Connecting your community and new platforms **may take several hours depending on the volume of data collected**. You can leave the page, an email will be sent once the integration is ready.

Learn more about all our available integrations [here](/integrations).

**Connecting multiple platforms**

New members will be created for all new platforms you connect to Conquest. **For every members with the same email address, members will be automatically merge**. Otherwise, you will need to merge profile manually. Learn more on [merge profile](/workspace/merge).


## Data Synchronization

After connecting your community, Conquest automatically pulls data to create member profiles and company records. Companies are created based on email domains, and members are linked to their respective companies.

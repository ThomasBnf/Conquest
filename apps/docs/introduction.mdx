### What is Conquest ?

Conquest is a Community CRM built to help community teams optimize their strategy thanks to meaningful insights. It combines powerful data aggregation, advanced segmentation, and smart analytics, giving you everything you need to manage and scale your community in one place.

### Who is it for?

Conquest is built for **B2B SaaS companies** looking to leverage their user community, empower members, support them in their daily challenges, and drive business growth through community engagement.

Itâ€™s for those who want to place their **community at the core of their strategy** and understand the power of an engagement one. 

Conquest helps community experts **become data-driven**, turning insights into action to maximize community impact.

### Why a Community CRM?

Conquest positions itself as a Community CRM because there is a critical lack of 360 tools in the community ecosystem. Time management is already complicated enough daily, and multiplying management tools only worsens your situation: scattered data, incorrect information, excessive costs, and a lot of time wasted juggling from one tool to another.

Our vision is to offer you an all-in-one tool for managing your community:

- A multi-platform data aggregator
- Actionable metrics and insights

Conquest is more than just a data platform, it's your companion to scale your community and prove its impact.

## What is Conquest ?

Conquest is a Community CRM built to help teams scale their communities and optimize their strategy with actionable insights. It combines rich data aggregation, advanced segmentation, smart analytics and powerful automations, giving you everything you need to achieve your community goals.


## Who is it for?

Conquest is built for B2B SaaS and Web3 companies looking to leverage their user community, empower members, support them in their daily challenges, and drive business growth through community engagement.

Itâ€™s for those who know the power of an engaged community, and want to put it at the heart of their strategy.

Conquest helps community experts become data-driven, turning insights into action to maximize community impact.


## Why a Community CRM?

Conquest positions itself as a Community CRM because there is a critical lack of 360 tools in the community ecosystem. Time management is already complicated enough daily, and multiplying management tools only worsens your situation: scattered data, incorrect information, excessive costs, and a lot of time wasted juggling from one tool to another.

Our vision is to offer an all-in-one tool for managing your community:

- A multi-platform data aggregator
- Actionable metrics and insights
- Automations and community alerts via workflows (soon)

Conquest is more than just a data platform, it's your companion to scale your community and prove its impact.

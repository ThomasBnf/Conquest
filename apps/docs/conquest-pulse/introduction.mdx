Meet the Conquest Pulse – the rhythm behind your community’s growth.

The Conquest Pulse is the built-in framework inside Conquest that helps you measure, understand, and grow your community. It brings clarity to member activity, reveals engagement patterns, and turns participation into long-term value.


## The Foundation

Community engagement is a powerful driver of business success. However, measuring and optimizing community impact remains a challenge. Traditional engagement tracking often relies on scattered data and vanity metrics, making it difficult to extract actionable insights or demonstrate real business value.

The Conquest Pulse provides a structured framework to quantify, analyze, and enhance engagement, enables community experts to:


### Measure engagement with precision

Track activities across platforms and assign weighted values to interactions.


### Identify and nurture key contributors

Segment members based on their level of commitment.


### Align community efforts with business outcomes

Link engagement to growth metrics, demonstrating the impact of community initiatives.

By transforming raw participation data into a clear, structured engagement model, Conquest Pulse empowers community experts to make informed decisions, optimize strategies, and scale their impact effectively.


## The Concept

Imagine a community as a living ecosystem. Just like any living being, community thrives on energy, grows through interactions, and become stronger with every meaningful connection.

At its core lies a heartbeat - what we call its Pulse - a steady rhythm that powers every interaction, shared moment, and collective achievement.

This Pulse reflects the health of your community through three key rhythms:


### Intensity

The impact of individual actions. It shows how individual contributions create value. Strong actions amplify your community's perceived worth, naturally attracting and retaining members through visible impact and demonstrated value.


### Regularity

The frequency of member participation and engagement. A consistent flow of interactions highlights your community's ability to deliver value over time. Regular member participation and contributions confirm the importance of your community in their journey to success.


### Variations

The balance between peak moments and quiet periods. A healthy community actively drives regular peak moments. Creating consistent high-energy activities (events, challenges, discussions) maintains momentum and prevents stagnation, keeping your community vibrant and growing.

Understanding your community's Pulse becomes your compass for growth. It's not just about measuring metrics, but about feeling the rhythm and nurturing sustainable value creation.


## The Methodology

The Conquest Pulse helps categorize members by level, ranging from **Explorer to Ambassador**, based on their engagement and involvement. It provides insights into where engagement originates and encourages members to take actions with a greater impact.

This system is based on all activities a member performs both within and outside the community.

By identifying a member’s activities across multiple platforms, it becomes possible to determine their actual level of engagement beyond community, gain a deeper understanding of their customer journey, and uncover growth opportunities.

Two key metrics define the Conquest Pulse: 

1. **Pulse Score**, which is the sum of all activities performed by a member in the last 90 days, multiplied by their respective score.
2. **Member Level**, determined by thresholds that indicate varying degrees of engagement.
